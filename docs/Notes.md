```
Messages, commands and requests sent by users are passed to the software running on your servers. Our intermediary server handles all encryption and communication with the Telegram API for you. You communicate with this server via a simple HTTPS-interface that offers a simplified version of the Telegram API. We call that interface our Bot API.

- [Bot Privacy Mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode)
```
Privacy mode is enabled by default for all bots, except bots that were added to the group as admins (bot admins always receive all messages). It can be disabled, so that the bot receives all messages like an ordinary user. We only recommend doing this in cases where it is absolutely necessary for your bot to work â€” users can always see a bot's current privacy setting in the group members list. In most cases, using the force reply option for the bot's messages should be more than enough.

2. Bot admins and bots with privacy mode disabled will receive all messages except messages sent by other bots.
